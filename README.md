# West End VR Project Resources

## Overview
This repository contains resources for creating VR experiences focused on historical West End buildings and environments. These materials support creating interactive virtual reality applications for exploring and learning about historical architecture and urban spaces.

## Repository Structure

### Scripts
The `Scripts` folder contains C# scripts for Unity that enable various interactive features:

- **BuildingTrigger.cs**: Creates information panels that appear when users approach buildings
- **DialogueCanvasHelper.cs**: Manages UI elements for dialogue panels
- **NPCDialogueManager.cs**: Controls dialogue content and audio for NPC interactions
- **NPCWalking.cs**: Manages NPC movement between waypoints
- **PictureFrameTrigger.cs**: Displays historical images when users approach specific areas
- **SkyboxViewpoint.cs**: Creates areas where users can view present-day panoramic skybox imagery

### Tutorials
The `Tutorials` folder contains step-by-step markdown guides for implementing various features:

- **Unity Setup for West End Project**: Initial Unity configuration and VR setup
- **West End VR Modeling Project - Student Guide**: Guidelines for creating 3D models in SketchUp
- **GitHub Guide for West End VR Project**: How to use GitHub for project management
- **Importing SketchUp Models into Unity**: Process for bringing models from SketchUp into Unity
- **Applying Materials to Architectural Models in Unity**: Adding realistic materials to buildings
- **Creating Building Information Triggers in Unity VR**: Setting up interactive information displays
- **Setting Up a VR Tour Guide NPC in Unity**: Creating an animated NPC guide with dialogue
- **Creating Picture Frame Displays**: Setting up historical images that appear when approached
- **Implementing Present-Day Skybox Viewpoints**: Creating areas where users can see modern-day 360° views
